# Library Card Registration System

A simple frontend-based web application that allows users to register for a library card, upload ID proof, verify phone numbers using a simulated OTP, and preview their digital card. An admin panel (demo mode) allows viewing, approving, and rejecting applications — all stored locally using browser localStorage.

## Features
- User registration form with validation
- Simulated OTP send + verify
- Upload ID proof (image/PDF)
- Auto-generated Member ID
- Live preview of digital library card
- Admin login (demo password: admin123)
- Approve/Reject applications
- View approved members list

## Tech Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- SVG for barcode generation

## Notes
- This is a demo only; no backend is used.
- The OTP is simulated and shown directly on the screen for testing.
